# AntiEbay
Nowadays, websites selling all kind of products (see Amazon, Ebay, etc.) follow a straightforward 
business model. They expose the product they want to sell, they provide some description, price, 
images, and feedback from customers who already purchased the product.  
Our goal is to revolutionize the selling process by highlighting the needs of the buyer rather than 
the products of the seller. This website  should work exactly as the  opposite of Ebay. Instead of 
advertising  the  products  available,  we  should  focus  on  the  needs  of  the  customer  and  let  the 
sellers compete for the customers. 

# Objectives
a) Create a website <br />
b) Handle seller and buyer profiles (login, rights, etc.) <br />
c) Provide visually appealing  graphical interface to describe the needs of the buyer <br />
d) Provide searchability capabilities for the sellers, ranking, bidding, etc. <br />
